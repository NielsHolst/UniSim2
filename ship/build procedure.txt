- Update SUB version number.
- Note that the bin target folder will be erased before building.
- Note that the batch file will switch UniSim2.pro to release mode before building and then restore it to debug mode at the end.
- Note that C:\data\QDev\UniSim2\input will be copied to C:\data\QDev\UniSim2\src\resources\data\input. Subsequently, the resource file in C:\data\QDev\UniSim2\src\resources\application.qrc will be updated accordingly.

2. Check that the input folder contains the correct files in
- book
