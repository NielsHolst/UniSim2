(A) Windows
=======
1. Edit C:\data\QDev\UniSim2\ship\cmd\win\build.bat.
- Update SUB version number.
- Note that the bin target folder will be erased before building.
- Note that the batch file will switch UniSim2.pro to release mode before building and then restore it to debug mode at the end.
- Note that C:\data\QDev\UniSim2\input will be copied to C:\data\QDev\UniSim2\src\resources\data\input. Subsequently, the resource file in C:\data\QDev\UniSim2\src\resources\application.qrc will be updated accordingly.

2. Check that the input folder contains the correct files in
- book
- papers
- projects
- scripts
- teaching

3. Check that UniSim2.pro contains the intended plug-ins (student and vg always included).

4. In the student source remove day_scale and weather files.

5. If the Qt installation has been updated, check that QTENV is set correctly in build.bat and QT_ROOT, in fill-folders.bat.

6. In fill-folders.bat UNISIM_SHIP must be the correct folder.

7. If unisim(d).exe is running, access will be denied to clear the UniSim2/bin folder: Close unisim(d).exe before building.

8.Execute batch file ***as administrator***.

(9). Upload installer from C:\data\QDev\UniSim2\ship to ecolmod.org/download (~37 Mb) med FileZilla.

(10). Update ecolmod.org/download.html.

11. In Bash:
cd /c/users/au152367/Documents/QDev/UniSim2

> git commit -F "../commit-msg.txt"
> git tag 2.3.n
> git push origin master --tags
- Note this pushes both source code changes and tags

12. Do not erase the src/resources folder. This is part of the commit and is used by the subsequent build on Mac OS (and Linux).

(B) Mac OS X
