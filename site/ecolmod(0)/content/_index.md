## Mission

"A probable scenario for ecological modelling is that standardized objects for at least some components of ecosystems will be developed and widely distributed in a form that can be used in many different models." - Silvert W (1993), Ecological Modelling 68: 91-118.

"What modellers need is a standardized set of tools that will enable them to collaborate and share model components, pieces of well-defined software objects that can be interchanged and combined freely: Download the annual life cycle models of species A and B, combine them with soil model C and weather generator D, and set it all in the context of cropping system model E. We need a way out of modeling as a purely personal, or in the best case, small-team exercise." - Holst N (2010), Weed Science 58: 497-502.


## Values

"Proprietary code has no place, neither in science where the code itself, the ecological model, is the very substance of the science, nor in politics where models form the evidence upon which policy decisions are taken." - Holst N (2013), Ecological Informatics 13: 70-76.

## Activities

The lab runs an Ecological Modelling Online course every autumn. Some course alumni choose to maintain their connection to the lab, at first to finish their model, later maybe to start new modelling projects in collaboration.

You are welcome as a guest student or scientist at the lab's physical facilities at Aarhus University, Denmark.

## Online

Since we are scattered around the world, we stay in touch mostly online. You must be a member of the lab to gain online access.
