\US\ is the open-source software used to run models developed within the \US\ modelling framework. \US\ works with Linux, OS X and Windows operating systems.
To see the output from \US\ you need to install R as well (\iref{ch:install-r}).

\section{First time installation}
To install \US\ visit \url{www.ecolmod.org/download.html} and download the \concept{\US\ Installer} appropriate to your operating system. 

\section{Updating the installation}
You do not need to uninstall any previously installed version of \US\ version before installing the new version, but you might as well do it to keep your computer free from obsolete files. 

Any earlier work you did with \US\ will not be overwritten, when you install a new \US\ version. First time you run the new version of \US, the whole \ushomeexplained\ folder will be backed up, as described for the \code{reconfigure} command (\iref{commands:reconfigure}).
